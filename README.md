*Basic-LTI* is a simple LTI 1.3 app developed as a way to demonstrate how to build an IMS LTI tool provider using the [ceLTIc LTI class library](https://github.com/celtic-project/LTI-PHP). It is based on the [Rating LTI app](https://github.com/celtic-project/Rating-PHP). The application simply displays information from the platform.

**TBD:** The wiki area of this repository contains [documentation](https://github.com/celtic-project/Rating-PHP/wiki) for installing and using this application.
